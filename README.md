CitrusHackathonProject
======================

The BenMark Standard scripting language, built in 42 hours for CitrusHack. Syntax is similar to that of Javascript and Python, you can see examples of it with the .bsscript files included in the repository.

The language is interpreted in C++, and supports daisy-chained operations, function calls, function arguments, and variable scoping.

To build, simply run make in your terminal. You can execute a script file through ./Interpreter.exe [scriptfile]
